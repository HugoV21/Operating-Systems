#### Hypervisor : The software, firmware, or hardware that VM's (virtual machines) run on.
#### Two or more O/S' on one computer

#### Purpose of VM's:
- Testing apps in different enviroment 
- Running software designed for a different O/S.
- Running outdated software

#### Virtual Computing Environments, known as instances
#### Pre-configured templates known as Amazon Machine Images (AMI's)

### Key Benefits of EC2
- Elastic Web Scale Computing
- Completely controlled 
- Flexible Cloud Hosting Service
- Integrated 
- Reliable
- Secure & Inexpensive

### Instance Types
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized 
- Memory Optimized 
- Accelerated Computing 
- Storage Optimized

### Four Pillars Of AWS Cost Optimization 
1. Right size - CPU, Memory, Storage
2. Increase Elasticity 
3. Leverage the right pricing model
4. Optimize Storage
